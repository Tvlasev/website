            <div class="description">For holders of Million, there is unlimited upside. Unlike traditional stablecoins (pegged to 1 Token = 1 $USDC), Million has a fixed supply and therefore has an unbound maximum. As Million gains popularity and circulation, it could potentially reach higher values being worth as much as 10 million or 100 million theoretically. The moon is the limit.</div>
